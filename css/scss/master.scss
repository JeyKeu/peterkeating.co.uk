/**
* =============================================================================
* $NOTES
* Worth reading before you get started.
* =============================================================================
*
* This stylesheet uses principles and conventions that can be viewed
* here (https://github.com/necolas/idiomatic-css). Lets try and keep
* to these conventions as best as possible.
*
* Any deviations or problems with the conventions should be discussed
* and documentated beneath here so anyone working on the stylesheet
* can be made aware.
*
* STANDARDS
*  -   Properties within a style declaration are ordered alphabetically not in
*      order of importance.
*  -   Multi-line comments have to use the * due to syntax highlighting in
*      sublime doesn't handle multi line comments very well.
*  -   When dealing with attributes that affect the type (borders, font-size,
*      margins & padding). See here for more details as to why
*      (http://csswizardry.com/2011/12/measuring-and-sizing-uis-2011-style/).
*  -   No need to use a unit on the end of line-height.
*      (http://meyerweb.com/eric/thoughts/2006/02/08/unitless-line-heights/)
*  -   Never go four levels deep when nesting
*      (http://thesassway.com/beginner/the-inception-rule).
*
* FONTS
*      Currently the fonts are handled using typekit (https://typekit.com/).
*      Available fonts:
*          - ff-tisa-web-pro
*
* Happy CSS'ing :)
